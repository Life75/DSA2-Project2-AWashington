This program askes for given values of mu, lambda, the amount of service channels, and the amount of customers wanted to simulate.
This program acts off of the poisson distribution and gives an analytical model based off that with comparison to the actual
simulated results in the simulation. The analytical and simulation model with both appear at the end of the program.
